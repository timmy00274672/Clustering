Clustering
==========
Here is the dataset:

![dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timmy00274672/Clustering/master/img/dataset.jpg)

1. 
	Write a program to implement the **k-means** clustering for **three** clusters with initial centers located at 

	* [0,0,0]' [1,1,1]' [-1,0,2]'
	* [-0.1,0,0.1]' [0,-0.1,0.1]' [-0.1,-0.1,0.1]'

	Compare the results and explain any difference, including the number of iterations for convergence. 

2.
	Write a program to cluster the data set into three clusters using the **fuzzy k-means** clustering methods with *randomly* initialized representatives.

3.
	To cluster the data set by using **Modified Basic Sequential Algorithm** scheme with unknown cluster number.

4.
	According to your results obtained in the previous three methods, give some comments.
